# Contributions & Workflow

As per the project requirements:
> have a contributions document that outlines how the team will work together (expected workflow practices)

## Task Delegation

All parties will complete functions, which will later be merged. Then testing will be split up as well.


## Expected Workflow

Members will regularly push separate files to separate branches. Working in separate files should mitigate potential merge conflicts.

Members should also write unit tests in their own unit testing files in parallel to the code that they write.
