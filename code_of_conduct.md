# Code of Conduct

As per the project requirements:
> have a code of conduct document that describes behavioural expectations of team interactions

## Communication

Communication will occur through the Discord group chat. 


## Meetings

Meetings on ad hoc basis, with general touchpoints made in classes on Mondays through Thursdays, especially during DATA 534 Labs on Monday afternoons.


## Conflict Resolution

As there are three of us in the group, if two members are having an issue, the third one will be consulted to determine the best course of action. If all three are having a disagreement, all sides will be heard and considered to make an internal agreement.
